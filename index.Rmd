Welcome to the website of the Google Summer of Code 2017 project Non-invasive
source code formatting, a source code formatter for the R language. 

Over the course of three months [Lorenz Walthert](www.lorenzwalthert.github.io/about)
and his two mentors [Kirill MÃ¼ller]() and 
[Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/) worked on the R package styler, which
evolved from a proof of concept to a ready-for-production source code formatter.
Because it is so exciting and pictures say more than 1000 words, we just want 
you to show how it works.

```{r, out.width = "'50px'100%'", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzwalthert/some_raw_data/master/styler_0.1.gif")
```

# Functionality

The package can style text, single files, packages and entire R source trees. 
In brief, styler works as follows:

1. Create a abstract syntax tree (AST) from `utils::getParseData()` that
   contains positional information of every token. We call
   this a nested parse table.
2. Apply transformer functions at each level of the nested parse table. In 
   particular, modify information about the position of the token.
3. Serialize the nested parse table, that is, extract the terminal tokens from 
   the nested parse table and add spaces and line breaks between them as 
   specified in the nested parse table. 

A style guide applied to code is hence just a set of transformer functions 
applied to each level of nesting. The main goal of this GSOC project was to 
provide infrastructure that allows performing the above steps and implementing
one particular style guide: 
The [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org). However, since 
technically speaking, the style guide is just a set of transformer functions,
everybody can implement a style guide. There is a [vignette]() that describes how
to do that with an example.
